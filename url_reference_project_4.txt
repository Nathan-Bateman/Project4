When I began the project. I had no clue how to start. I read through many posts and finally viewed
the code of others. Mainly, the one above. I saw how he did things such as the switch statement to 
get the player to move and confine him to the space. I implemented a very similar style of making
players move with my own. I understand the switch statement, but if I need to accomplish it some other
way, I am happy to do that as well. I also got insights in the way of storing different positions and
speeds in an array and then selecting one for implementation at different times. I looked up the 
methods of accomplishing this from other sources.
